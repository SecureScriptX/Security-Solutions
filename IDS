## What is IDS?

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is hardware or software used to detect security breaches and attacks by monitoring a network or host.

## Types of IDS

There are many many (5) types of IDS products:

### Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is used to detect traffic suitable for attacker behavior by analyzing all network traffic. Abnormal behavior triggers alerts to notify administrators.

### Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)

The Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) operates on a specific host, examining all network packets arriving at and departing from the device. Detected malicious behaviors are reported to the administrator as alerts.

### Protocol-Based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS)

A Protocol-Based Intrusion Detection System (PIDS) examines the traffic between a server and a client in a protocol-specific way.

### Application Protocol-Based Intrusion Detection System (APIDS)

An Application Protocol-Based Intrusion Detection System (APIDS) detects security breaches by monitoring communication in application-specific protocols.

### Hybrid Intrusion Detection System

A Hybrid Intrusion Detection System combines two or more violation detection approaches.

## Functions of IDS

- Detecting security breaches based on the detection methods used by the IDS product is its primary task.
- When IDS detects a security breach, the administrator is informed, and/or this information is sent to the SIEM product.

## Importance of IDS for Security

IDS is crucial for detecting malicious behavior, and a network is considered lacking in security without it. As a technologically mature product, IDS plays a vital role in detecting security breaches. It is recommended to be used in conjunction with other security products, as IDS alone lacks the ability to take action. Integrating it with a security product that can take additional action enhances overall effectiveness.

Some popular IDS products used in the cybersecurity industry include:

- Zeek/Bro
- Snort
- Suricata
- Fail2Ban
- OSSEC

## What log sources does the IDS have?

During its operation, IDS detects security violations according to established rules. The accuracy of these rules is crucial in defining attacks. If a rule fails to detect an attack or identifies normal behavior as an anomaly, adjustments should be made. Analysts examining IDS logs find information in network packets related to security breaches.

## Physical Location of the IDS Device

The location of the IDS device in the network varies depending on its type. For example, a NIDS-type device must process all incoming network packets, making it suitable near devices providing access to the external network. Conversely, a HIDS-type device should be positioned close to the host, focusing on examining network packets coming to and leaving a specific host.

# Challenges of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

Every tool has its pros and cons, and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are no exception. It is essential to be aware of the challenges associated with IDS implementation.

**False Alarms:**
   - IDS systems may occasionally generate false alarms. To address this, organizations must proactively detect and configure the system during initial use. This involves setting up the system to easily identify normal traffic and distinguish any malicious activity.

**Serious Issues from False Alarms:**
   - False alarms, if not handled carefully, can lead to serious issues. There's a risk that IDS might overlook a threat amidst recognized traffic, leaving IT teams unaware of a potential attack. Vigilance is crucial to avoiding such situations and taking appropriate measures.

**Limited Resolution Capability:**
   - While IDS help monitor network activities, they lack the capability to block or resolve identified issues. Organizations must employ skilled personnel to promptly address and mitigate threats detected by IDS.

**Detection Challenges with New Threats:**
   - IDS faces a significant challenge in detecting new suspected intrusions, especially when new malware does not exhibit patterns of previous unusual behavior. Efforts should be made to enhance the IDS's ability to identify novel threats, allowing organizations to take immediate precautions against emerging risks.
