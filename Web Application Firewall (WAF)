# Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## What is a Web Application Firewall (WAF)?

Web Application Firewall (WAF) refers to security software or hardware designed to monitor, filter, and block incoming and outgoing packets to a web application.

## Types of WAF

There are several types of WAF products:

### Network-based WAF

Network-based WAF is hardware-based security on the relevant network. It requires staff to write and maintain rules, making it effective but more expensive than other WAF products.

### Host-based WAF

Host-based WAF is a cost-effective product with extensive customization possibilities. As a software product, it consumes server resources and may require secure system hardening for maintenance.

### Cloud-based WAF

Cloud-based WAF is a convenient and easy-to-implement security solution provided as an external service. It involves no additional costs for maintenance and updates, but customization suitability should be considered.

## How does a web application firewall (WAF) work?

A WAF manages inbound application traffic based on existing rules. Requests under the HTTP protocol are allowed or blocked according to these rules, preventing web-based attacks.

## The Importance of WAF for Security

In today's IT landscape, web applications are prevalent in local networks or on the Internet. Securing these widely used applications is critical to prevent data leaks and security breaches. WAF products are crucial in this context, serving as a frontline defense for web applications. While the presence of a WAF is essential for application security, its absence is strongly discouraged.
