## What is a Proxy Server?

A Proxy Server, whether hardware or software, serves as a gateway between clients and servers, with diverse applications.

## Types of Proxy Servers (21)

### Forward Proxy Server
The most widely used type directing requests from a private network to the internet through a firewall.

### Transparent Proxy Server
Directs requests and responses to the target without altering them.

### Anonymous Proxy Server
Enables anonymous browsing on the internet.

### High Anonymity Proxy Server
Enhances client confidentiality by not revealing proxy server type and client IP address in the request.

### Distorting Proxy Server
Attempts to hide its identity by presenting itself as the proxy server of a website.

### Data Center Proxy Server
A special proxy not connected to the ISP, offering quick response features.

### Residential Proxy Server
Passes all client requests, blocking unwanted and suspicious advertisements for enhanced security.

### Public Proxy Server
Free for everyone, sacrificing security and speed.

### Shared Proxy Server
Used by multiple users simultaneously, providing a fast connection but with potential downsides.

### SSL Proxy Server
Ensures bidirectional encrypted communication between client and server for increased safety.

### Rotating Proxy Server
Assigns a separate IP address to each client.

### Reverse Proxy Server
Validates and processes transactions without direct client-server communication.

### Split Proxy Server
Runs as two programs on different computers.

### Non-Transparent Proxy Server
Sends all requests to the firewall, with clients aware of the firewall involvement.

### Hostile Proxy Server
Used for eavesdropping on web traffic between client and target.

### Intercepting Proxy Server
Combines proxy server and gateway features.

### Forced Proxy Server
Applies blocking and allowing policies simultaneously.

### Caching Proxy Server
Includes a caching mechanism, saving bandwidth with cached responses.

### Web Proxy Server
Specifically works on web traffic.

### Socks Proxy Server
Prevents external components from obtaining client information.

### HTTP Proxy Server
A proxy with a caching mechanism for HTTP protocol.

## Benefits of Proxy Server

- Private browsing
- Increased user security
- Hides client's IP address
- Manages network traffic
- Saves bandwidth with caching
- Provides access to restricted places

## How Does a Proxy Work?

Proxy servers act as intermediaries between clients and targets, directing requests and managing network traffic.

## The Importance of Proxy Servers for Security

Proxy servers play vital roles in security, hiding client IP addresses and managing traffic effectively. SOC Analysts need to carefully analyze traffic from proxies, as source IP addresses belong to proxy servers. Additionally, encryption support is crucial for secure transmission.
