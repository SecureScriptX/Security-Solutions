# Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

## What is IPS?

An **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** is hardware or software designed to detect security violations by monitoring a network or host and taking necessary actions to prevent such violations.

## Types of IPS

1. **Network-Based Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)**

   Network-based intrusion prevention system (NIPS) is a type of IPS that detects and eliminates security violations by monitoring all incoming traffic to the network it is in.

2. **Host-Based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)**

   Host-based intrusion prevention system (HIPS) is software that monitors and analyzes suspicious activities for a host.

3. **Network Behavior Analysis (NBA)**

   Network Behavior Analysis (NBA) is a type of IPS that detects and blocks unusual traffic flows and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks on the network.

4. **Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS)**

A Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS) is a type of IPS that monitors and analyzes wireless network protocol traffic of wireless devices in a network.

## Functions of IPS

- IPS is responsible for preventing malicious behavior by detecting security breaches.
- It notifies the relevant authorities of the security breach encountered during monitoring as an alert.


## The Importance of IPS for Security

IPS is an important security product that should be included in an organization. Having the ability to take action against the security breach it has detected makes a great contribution to ensuring security. As with any security solution, it must be used and configured correctly. It is not recommended to be installed and left to work without constant control by the personnel. It must be followed by the cyber security personnel whether the IPS product is working or not and whether it takes the right action.

### Popular IPS Products:

- Cisco NGIPS
- Suricata
- Fidelis

## What log resources does IPS have?

The IPS device has log content similar to the IDS device. In terms of their duties, IDS and IPS have similar features at one point. Some of the information that can be included in the IPS logs is as follows:

- Date/Time Information
- Message About the Attack
- Source IP Address
- Source Port
- Destination IP Address
- Destination Port
- Action Information
- Device Name

## Physical Location of IPS Device

The location of the IPS device in the network may vary depending on which type of IPS it is. In general terms, it should be placed at whatever point it needs to be located in the network due to its task.
